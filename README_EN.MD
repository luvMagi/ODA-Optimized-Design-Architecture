# 🧠 ODA – Optimized Design Architecture

> From one design, comes everything  
> Design once, generate all

---

## 🌐 Project Philosophy

**ODA (Optimized Design Architecture)** is a modern design automation platform that transforms a unified design input into multiple essential deliverables, including **web screen specifications, report definitions, and database models**.

> **Design once, generate all.**  
> One definition, many outputs. ODA ensures design consistency, accelerates delivery, and improves quality across the board.

## 🧩 Modular Structure

ODA is composed of three core solution areas based on output type and design process:

### 1. Screen Design Support

- Standardizes screen logic, UI components, and event flows  
- Automatically generates detailed screen specifications in Excel or other formats

### 2. Report Design Support

- Defines layout structure, CSV columns, and control logic in a unified format  
- Automatically produces report templates, SVF configurations, and CSV mock data

### 3. Database Design Support

- Supports ER-to-DDL conversion, field mapping, and schema difference analysis  
- Generates database design documents, procedure call graphs, and table structure listings

## 📁 Application Scenarios

- 💻 Batch generation of detailed screen design documents for web systems  
- 📄 Unified report output definitions including SVF, CSV, and control metadata  
- 🗃 Consistent database modeling from ER diagrams to deployable schemas  
- 🧠 AI-assisted framework for automated generation and integration with Copilot-like tools  
- 📦 Extensible template system supporting various formats (Excel / Markdown / XML / etc.)
